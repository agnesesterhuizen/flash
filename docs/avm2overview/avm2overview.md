# <span id="page-4-1"></span><span id="page-4-0"></span>1 Introduction

The Adobe® ActionScript™ Virtual Machine 2, or AVM2 for short, was designed to execute programs written in the ActionScript 3.0 language. ActionScript 3.0 is based on ECMAScript, the international standardized programming language for scripting. ActionScript 3.0 is compliant with the ECMAScript Language Specification, Third Edition ([ECMA-262](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)). It also contains functionality based on ongoing work on ECMAScript Edition 4, occurring within the Ecma International standards body.

This document describes the operation of the AVM2 and defines the file formats, data structures, and instruction formats used by the AVM2.

## <span id="page-4-2"></span>*1.1 Concepts*

The AVM2 was designed to support the ActionScript (AS) 3.0 language, and for the remaining chapters it is assumed that the reader is aware of the terminology and concepts of the language.

The following vocabulary and associated definitions are taken from the ActionScript 3.0 Language Specification and are presented only as a review of the material. For full details, refer to the language specification.

- Virtual Machine—A virtual machine is a mechanism that takes as its input the description of a computation and that performs that computation. For the AVM2, the input is in the form of an *ABC file*, which contains compiled programs; these comprise *constant data*, *instructions* from the AVM2 instruction set, and various kinds of *metadata*.
- Script—A script set of traits and an initializer method; a script populates a top-level environment with definitions and data.
- Bytecode, code—Bytecode or code is a specification of computation in the form of a sequence of simple actions on the virtual machine state.
- Scope—Scope is a mapping from names to locations, where no two names are the same. Scopes can nest, and nested scopes can contain *bindings* (associations between names and locations) that shadow the bindings of the nesting scope.
- Object—An object is an unordered collection of named properties, which are containers that hold values. A value in ActionScript 3.0 is either an Object reference or one of the special values null or undefined.
- Namespace—Namespaces are used to control the visibility of a set of properties independent of the major structure of the program.
- Class—A class is a named description of a group of objects. Objects are created from classes by *instantiation*.
- Inheritance—New classes can be derived from older classes by the mechanism known as inheritance or *subclassing*. The new class is called the *derived class* or *subclass* of the old class, and the old class is called the *base class* or *superclass*.
- Trait—A trait is a fixed-name property shared by all objects that are instances of the same class; a set of traits expresses the type of an object.
- Method—The word *method* is used with two separate meanings. One meaning is a *method body*, which is an object that contains code as well as data that belong to that code or that describe the code. The other meaning is a *method closure*, which is a method body together with a reference to the environment in which the closure was created. In this document, functions, constructors, ActionScript 3.0 class methods, and other objects that can be invoked are collectively referred to as method closures.

- Verification—The contents of an ABC file undergo verification when the file is loaded into the AVM2. The ABC file is rejected by the verifier if it does not conform to the AVM2 Overview. Verification is described in Chapter [3](#page-13-1).
- Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler—AVM2 implementations may contain an optional run-time compiler for transforming AVM2 instructions into processor-specific instructions. Although not an implementation requirement, employing a JIT compiler provides a performance benefit for many applications.

# <span id="page-6-1"></span><span id="page-6-0"></span>2 The structure of the ActionScript Virtual Machine

## <span id="page-6-2"></span>*2.1 Constant values*

The constant values of the AVM2 are one of the following types: int, uint, double, string, namespace, undefined, or null. The values of these types appear directly in the ABC file or in the instruction encodings. Important characteristics of these types are:

- int—This type is used to represent an integer valued number whose values are 32-bit signed two's complement integers. The range of values is from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (-231 to 231-1), inclusive.
- uint—This type is used for integer valued numbers with values that are 32-bit unsigned two's complement integers. The range of values is from 0 to 4,294,967,296 (232), inclusive.
- double—This type is used for capturing floating point numbers using 64-bit double precision IEEE 754 values as specified in IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic (ANSI/IEEE Standard. 754- 1985).
- string—This type represents a sequence of Unicode characters. Strings are represented in UTF-8 and can be as long as 230-1 bytes.
- namespace—Namespaces tie a URI (represented internally by a string) to a trait. The relationship is unidirectional, meaning the namespace data type only contains a URI. Each namespace is also of a particular kind, and there are restrictions regarding the relationships between the trait and kind. These rules are defined later in this chapter.
- null—A singleton value representing "no object".
- undefined—A singleton value representing "no meaningful value". This constant value is allowed only in certain contexts.

The AVM2 utilizes several representations for values in its instruction encoding and in the ABC file in order to provide as compact an encoding as is required.

## <span id="page-6-3"></span>*2.2 Virtual machine overview*

Computation in the AVM2 is based on executing the *code* of a *method body* in the context of *method information*, a *local data area*, a *constant pool*, a *heap* for non-primitive data objects created at run-time, and a *run-time environment*. Many data elements are static and are read at startup from an *ABC file*, whose structure is defined in Chapter [4.](#page-17-1)

- The code for a method body is composed of *instructions*, defined in Chapter [5](#page-34-1). Each instruction modifies the state of the machine in some way, or has an effect on the external environment by means of input or output.[1](#page-6-4)
- The method information determines how the method is used—for example, how default argument values should be substituted for missing arguments when the method is called.
- The local data area for the method consists of the *operand stack*, the *scope stack*, and the *local registers*.

<span id="page-6-4"></span><sup>1</sup> In practice, the AVM2 may transform the code at run-time by means of a JIT, but this does not affect the semantics of execution, only its performance.

- <span id="page-7-0"></span>o The operand stack holds operands for the instructions and receives their results. Arguments are pushed onto the stack top or popped off the stack top. The top element always has address 0; the one below it has address 1, and so on. Stack addresses are not used except as a specification mechanism.
- o The scope stack is part of the run-time environment and holds objects that are to be searched by the AVM2 when an instruction is executed that calls for *name lookup*. Instructions push elements onto the scope stack as part of the implementation of exception handling, closure creation, and for the ActionScript 3.0 with statement.
- o The local registers hold parameter values, local variables in some cases, and temporaries.
- The constant pool holds constant values that are referenced, ultimately, by the instruction stream: numbers, strings, and various kinds of names.
- Instructions and the AVM2 can create new objects at run-time, and these objects are allocated in the heap. The only way to access the heap is through an object allocated in it. Objects in the heap that are no longer needed will eventually be reclaimed by the AVM2.
- The run-time environment logically consists of a chain of objects, and named properties on these objects are the locations found during a name lookup at run-time. Name lookup proceeds from the innermost (most recently pushed) scope toward the outermost (global) scope.

The creation of a method closure causes the run-time environment that is current at the time of creation to be captured in the closure; when the closure is later invoked, that scope is made current, and will be extended by the code in the method body.

## <span id="page-7-1"></span>*2.3 Names*

Names in the AVM are represented by a combination of an unqualified *name* and one or more *namespaces*. These are collectively called *multinames*. Multiname entries usually consist of a name index, and a namespace or namespace set index. Some multinames can have the name and/or namespace part resolved at runtime. There are a number of different types of multinames as described below. Properties of objects are always named by a simple QName (a pair of name and namespace). The other types of multinames are used to resolve properties at runtime.

RTQName, RTQNameL, and MultinameL are collectively referred to as runtime multinames.

## <span id="page-7-2"></span>2.3.1 QName (Qualified Name)

This is the simplest form of a multiname. It is a name with exactly one namespace, hence QName for qualified name. QName entries will have a name index followed by a namespace index. The name index is an index into the string constant pool, and the namespace index is an index into the namespace constant pool.

QNames are typically used to represent the names of variables, and for type annotations.

```
public var s : String;
```

This code will produce two QName entries, one for the variable s (public namespace, name "s") and one for the type String (public namespace, name "String").

# <span id="page-7-3"></span>2.3.2 RTQName (Runtime Qualified Name)

This is a runtime QName, where the namespace is not resolved until runtime. RTQName entries will have only a name index, which is an index into the string constant pool. The namespace is determined at runtime. When a RTQName is an operand to an opcode, there should be a namespace value on the stack the

<span id="page-8-0"></span>RTQName should use. So when the RTQName is used, the top value of the stack will be popped off, and the RTQName will use that as its namespace.

RTQNames are typically used for qualified names when the namespace is not known at compile time.

```
var ns = getANamespace(); 
x = ns::r;
```

This code will produce a RTQName entry for ns::r. It will have a name of "r" and code will be generated to push the value of ns onto the stack.

## <span id="page-8-1"></span>2.3.3 RTQNameL (Runtime Qualified Name Late)

This is a runtime QName, where both the name and namespace are resolved at runtime. When a RTQNameL is an operand to an opcode there will be a name and a namespace value on the stack. The name value on the stack must be of type String, and the namespace value on the stack must be of type Namespace.

RTQNameLs are typically used for qualified names when neither the name, nor the qualifier is known at compile time.

```
var x = getAName(); 
var ns = getANamespace(); 
w = ns::[x];
```

This code will produce a RTQNameL entry in the constant pool for ns::[x]. It has neither a name nor a namespace, but code will be generated to push the value of ns and x onto the stack.

## <span id="page-8-2"></span>2.3.4 Multiname (Multiple Namespace Name)

This is a multiname with a name and a namespace set. The namespace set is used to represent a collection of namespaces. Multiname entries will have a name index followed by a namespace set index. The name index is an index into the string constant pool, and the namespace set index is an index into the namespace set constant pool.

Multinames are typically used for unqualified names. In these cases all open namespaces are used for the multiname.

```
use namespace t; 
trace(f);
```

This code will produce a multiname entry for f. It will have a name of "f" and a namespace set for all the open namespaces (the public namespace, the namespace t, and any private or internal namespaces open in that context). At runtime f could be resolved in any of the namespaces specified by the multiname.

# 2.3.5 MultinameL (Multiple Namespace Name Late)

<span id="page-8-3"></span>This is a runtime multiname where the name is resolved at runtime. The namespace set is used to represent a collection of namespaces. MultinameL entries have a namespace set index. The namespace set index is an index into the namespace set constant pool. When a MultinameL is an operand to an opcode there will be a name value on the stack. The name value on the stack must be of type String.

MultinameLs are typically used for unqualified names where the name is not known at compile time.

```
use namespace t; 
trace(o[x]);
```

This code will produce a MultinameL entry. It will have no name, and will have a namespace set for all the open namespaces in that context. Code will be generated to push the value of x onto the stack, and that value will be used as the name.

## <span id="page-9-1"></span>2.3.6 Resolving multinames

Typically, the order of the search for resolving multinames is the object's declared traits, its dynamic properties, and finally the prototype chain.[2](#page-9-3) The dynamic properties and prototype chain search will only happen if the multiname contains the public namespace (dynamic properties are always in the public namespace in ActionScript 3.0; a run-time error is signaled if an attempt is add a non-public property). If a search does not include one or more of these locations, it is noted in the text in the following chapters. Otherwise, you can assume that all three are searched in this order to resolve a multiname.

If the multiname is any type of QName, then the QName will resolve to the property with the same name and namespace as the QName. If no property has the same name and namespace as the QName, the QName is unresolved on that object.

If the multiname has a namespace set, then the object is searched for any properties whose name is the same as the multinames name, and whose namespace matches any of the namespaces in the multinames namespace set. Since the multiname may have more than one namespace, there could be multiple properties that match the multiname. If there are multiple properties that match a TypeError is raised since it is ambiguous which property the multiname is referring to. If no properties match, then the multiname is unresolved on that object.

## <span id="page-9-2"></span>*2.4 Method invocation notes*

When invoking a method in the AVM2, the first argument is always the "this" value to be used in the method. All methods take at least 1 argument (the "this" value), followed by any declared arguments.

When invoking the [[Call]] property, the behavior is different for different types of closures. A closure is an object that contains a reference to a method, and the [[Call]] property acts differently depending on whether it is a function, method, or class closure. A function closure is one that is of a global method that isn't associated with any instance of a class. A method closure contains an instance method of a class, and will always remember its original "this" value.

```
function f(){} 
var a = f; // a is a function closure 
class C{ 
 function m(){} 
} 
var q = new C(); 
var a = q.m; // a is a method closure
```

If the closure is a function closure, then the first argument passed to [[Call]] is passed on to the method and gets used as the "this" value. If the first argument is null or undefined, then the global object will be used as the "this" value for the method.

<span id="page-9-3"></span>ECMAScript 3 supports prototyped-based inheritance. See ECMA 262 section 4.2.1 for a description of the prototype chain.

<span id="page-10-0"></span>If the closure is a method closure, then the first argument of [[Call]] will be ignored, and the saved "this" value for the method closure will be passed to the method as the first argument. A method closure records what its original "this" value was and always uses that instead of the first argument to [[Call]].

If the closure is a class closure, and there is 1 argument passed to [[Call]] (in addition to the "this" argument), then the call is treated as a type conversion, and the argument will be coerced to the type represented by the closure.

## <span id="page-10-1"></span>*2.5 Instruction set summary*

This section provides an overview of the AVM2 instruction set. By convention, instructions specific to a specific data type are named with a suffix which indicates the data type on which it operates. Specifically, the following suffixes are used: \_b (Boolean), \_a (any), \_i (int), \_d (double), \_s (string), \_u (unsigned), and \_o (object).

## <span id="page-10-2"></span>2.5.1 Load and store instructions

Local registers can be accessed using the following instructions: getlocal, getlocal0, getlocal1, getlocal2, getlocal3, setlocal, setlocal0, setlocal1, setlocal2, setlocal3.

## <span id="page-10-3"></span>2.5.2 Arithmetic instructions

The arithmetic instructions provide a full repertoire of mathematical operations. Zero, one, or more typically two operands are removed from the top of the stack and the result of the operation is pushed back onto the operand stack.

Addition is performed using one the following: increment, increment\_i, inclocal, inclocal\_i, add, add\_i.

Subtraction is accomplished using the following: decrement, decrement\_i, declocal, declocal\_i, subtract, subtract\_i.

Multiplication and division are achieved with multiply, multiply\_i, divide, and modulo.

In order to reverse the sign of a value, the negate or negate\_i instruction can be used.

There also exists a set of instructions that perform value comparisons on the top two entries on the stack replacing them with a true or false value. These include equals, strictequals, lessthan, lessequals, greaterthan, greaterequals, istype, istypelate, and in.

# <span id="page-10-4"></span>2.5.3 Bit manipulation instructions

Instructions that allow the bits of a value to be manipulated include bitnot, bitand, bitor, bitxor, lshift, rshift, urshift.

Prior to executing these instructions, the value to be operated upon is converted to an integer, if necessary.

# <span id="page-10-5"></span>2.5.4 Type conversion instructions

The ActionScript language is a loosely typed language where objects are freely converted into whatever types are necessary in order to complete an operation. In some cases explicit conversion is required and for those instances the coerce instructions are provided. These include coerce, convert\_b, coerce\_a, convert\_i, convert\_d, coerce\_s, convert\_s, convert\_u, and convert\_o.

## <span id="page-11-0"></span>2.5.5 Object creation and manipulation instructions

<span id="page-11-1"></span>Entities are created by using one of the following instructions: newclass, newobject, newarray, newactivation.

In order to invoke an object's constructor the instructions construct, constructsuper, and constructprop are used.

Namespaces can be constructed dynamically using dxns and dxnslate.

## 2.5.6 Stack management instructions

<span id="page-11-2"></span>A number of instructions provide direct access to manipulate values placed on the stack. Instructions that push a value directly include pushnull, pushundefined, pushtrue, pushfalse, pushnan, pushbyte, pushshort, pushstring, pushint, pushdouble, pushscope, and pushnamespace.

A value can be removed from the stack by using pop, while dup duplicates the value at the top of the stack, and similarly swap exchanges the top two values on the stack.

## 2.5.7 Control transfer instructions

<span id="page-11-3"></span>The control transfer instructions transfer execution to an instruction other than the one immediately following the transfer instruction. The transfer can be unconditional or based upon a comparison operation that is implicit with the instruction.

The conditional branches instructions include iflt, ifle, ifnlt, ifnle, ifgt, ifge, ifngt, ifnge, ifeq, ifne, ifstricteq, ifstrictne, iftrue, and iffalse. These instructions perform any necessary type conversions in order to implement the compare; the conversion rules are outlined in [ECMA-262](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm).

The label instruction is used to mark the target position of backwards branch instruction. Thus the target location of every backwards branch instruction should land on a label instruction.

The lookupswitch instruction provides a compact form for encoding a multi-way compare expression.

## 2.5.8 Function invocation and return instructions

<span id="page-11-4"></span>There are a number of instructions to invoke functions and methods. The call instruction implements a fully compliant rendition of Function.prototype.call of the ECMA-262 specification. To invoke object instance methods the callmethod instruction is utilized. Likewise for calling class, also known as static methods, callstatic exists. In order to invoke instance methods not on an object, but on its base class, callsuper is used. For named elements which are invoked as a method and for which the ActionScript compiler can validate the usage as such, callproperty and callproplex are available. The latter is for the case when the object for which the property being invoked exists on the stack.

For cases in which the return value of the call is never used, callpropvoid and callsupervoid can be used in place of callproperty and callsuper, respectively.

# <span id="page-11-5"></span>2.5.9 Exception instructions

An exception is thrown programmatically using the throw instruction. Exceptions can also be thrown by various AVM instructions when an abnormal condition is encountered.

The try/catch statement in the ActionScript language is translated into a table of intervals, and target instructions that are specified in the method body portion of the abc file. The table defines a range of instructions over which a given exception type may be caught. Thus if during the execution of a given set of instructions an exception is thrown and there is an associated entry in the exception table, program execution will continue at the target instruction specified in the table.

## <span id="page-12-0"></span>2.5.10Debugging instructions

<span id="page-12-1"></span>Unlike many traditional execution environments the debugging facilities of the AVM2 are tightly intertwined with a series of instructions that are placed directly in the execution stream. To track current file name and line number information debugfile and debugline are emitted at appropriate points in the instruction stream. In cases where additional debugging detail is required, the debug instruction is used. For example, the names of local variables are provided by this mechanism.

# <span id="page-13-1"></span><span id="page-13-0"></span>3 Loading, linking, verification, and execution

## <span id="page-13-2"></span>*3.1 Overview*

An ABC file is processed by the AVM2 in four logical phases, known as loading, linking, verification, and execution. These phases overlap and, in particular, verification overlaps with all of the other phases.

During *loading*, the ABC file is read into memory and decoded. For example, the constant pool is transformed to an in-memory data structure using different encodings. Verification at this stage is relative to the structure of the ABC file, which must conform to the definitions presented in the next chapter.

During *linking*, some names referenced from individual fields of the ABC file structure are resolved, and the resulting objects are linked together into a more complex data structure. For example, a class definition's "base class" field names the base class; resolving that name finds the definition of the base class, and a final class object for the derived class is created based on information from the two definition objects. Verification at this stage is relative to this web of objects: the names mentioned must resolve; the resulting traits sets must be coherent; and so on.

During *execution*, the bytecodes representing compiled code in the ABC file are run through an interpreter, thus performing computation. Verification at this stage is relative to the stream of instructions and the contents of the execution stack: instructions must not jump outside the bytecode array; instructions that require certain operand types can be applied only to operands whose known type is the correct one; the code must not use more stack and register space than it has reserved; and so on.

When verification fails during any of these phases, the AVM2 throws a VerifyError. VerifyErrors thrown during execution can be caught by the program.

The AVM2 interleaves linking with both loading and execution. When linking is performed during loading, forward references are precluded; for example, class definitions can only reference previously defined classes as base classes. In contrast, when linking is performed during execution, some references to undefined entities may not be flagged as errors; for example, a method that uses the name of a type that hasn't been defined may not cause a VerifyError to be thrown provided the method isn't invoked.

# <span id="page-13-3"></span>*3.2 Loading and linking*

During the loading and linking phase, the following steps occur. (Note that a fair amount of linking is deferred until the execution phase.)

- Each ABC file is loaded into memory and decoded. This initial decoding verifies that the ABC file has the correct structure and that the fields that matter at this stage contain valid references to other parts of the ABC file.
- Trait objects are created for classes and scripts.
- Subclass/superclass relationships are resolved. The trait set of each class's superclass is merged into the trait set for the class, and interfaces in the class's interface set are looked up. Early resolution ensures that the inheritance graph is a tree.
- The constant pool is constructed. Each reference to another element of the constant pool is resolved (it must be in range for the correct type).
- Method bodies are linked with their method information (signature) structures.

## <span id="page-14-1"></span><span id="page-14-0"></span>*3.3 Execution*

This section describes the state of the virtual machine as it is observed by the executing bytecode.

## <span id="page-14-2"></span>3.3.1 Program invocation and exit

One of the entries in the ABC file is an array of script\_info entries (see the next chapter). Each of these entries contains a reference to an initialization method for the script and a set of traits to be defined in the script's environment. The last entry in that array is the entry point for the ABC file; that is, the *last* entry's initialization method contains the *first* bytecode that's run when the ABC file is executed.

The other scripts' initialization blocks are run on demand, when entities exported from those scripts are first referenced by the program during property lookup.

As far as the virtual machine is concerned, the initialization blocks are normal methods, and they should signal normal termination by executing one of the return instructions (OP\_returnvalue, OP\_returnvoid). The value returned by a script is ignored.

## 3.3.2 Class initialization

<span id="page-14-3"></span>The class's static initializer will be run when the newclass instruction is executed on the class\_info entry for the class.

## 3.3.3 Method entry

<span id="page-14-4"></span>When a method body is first entered, its execution environment is set up in a particular way. In the following discussion, method\_info and method\_body\_info refer to structures defined in the next chapter.

When control enters a method, three local data areas are allocated for it, as outlined in Chapter [2](#page-6-1)—an operand stack segment, a scope stack segment, and a set of local registers. The operand stack segment holds operands to the instructions; values are pushed onto that stack or popped off it by most instructions. The scope stack segments holds scope objects in which the virtual machine will look up names at execution time. Objects are pushed onto the scope stack by OP\_pushscope and OP\_pushwith, and popped off by OP\_popscope and by the exception handling machinery. The local registers hold parameter values, local variables, and temporaries.

On method entry, the state of these data areas is as follows.

- The operand stack is empty and has room for method\_body\_info.max\_stack values.
- The scope stack is empty and has room for method\_body\_info.max\_scope\_stack values.
- There are method\_body\_info.local\_count registers.
- Register 0 holds the "this" object. This value is never null.
- Registers 1 through method\_info.param\_count holds parameter values coerced to the declared types of the parameters. If fewer than method\_body\_info.local\_count values are supplied to the call then the remaining values are either the values provided by default value declarations (optional arguments) or the value undefined.
- If NEED\_REST is set in method\_info.flags, the method\_info.param\_count+1 register is set up to reference an array that holds the superflous arguments.
- If NEED\_ARGUMENTS is set in method\_info.flags, the method\_info.param\_count+1 register is set up to reference an "arguments" object that holds all the actual arguments: see ECMA-262 for more information. (The AVM2 is not strictly compatible with ECMA-262; it creates an Array object for the "arguments" object, whereas ECMA-262 requires a plain Object.)

## <span id="page-15-1"></span><span id="page-15-0"></span>3.3.4 Execution mechanics

Execution begins with the first instruction of the code in the method\_body\_info. The address of this first instruction is 0. The first byte of each instruction is the opcode, which is followed by zero or more bytes of operands. The instruction may modify the local data areas as well as objects on the heap, and it may create new objects on the heap either directly or indirectly. (The AVM2 instruction set is defined in Section 2.5.)

Branch and jump instructions add a signed offset to the program counter to effectuate the branch. The base value for the program counter is the instruction address following the instruction.

## <span id="page-15-2"></span>3.3.5 Calling and returning

When one of the call instructions is executed, a new local data area is created for the called function. The called function has no access to the local data area of its caller. The actual parameter values are coerced to the types expected by the called function as part of the call protocol.

The return instructions transfer a single value from the returning function's stack, or the implied value undefined, to the caller. The returned value is coerced to the returning function's declared return type as part of the return protocol. The coerced value replaces the operands of the call instruction in the calling method's stack, and the called method's local data area is destroyed.

## 3.3.6 Exception handling

<span id="page-15-3"></span>Exception handlers are defined by a table associated with each method. The table defines a range of bytecode addresses across which a particular handler is active, the bytecode address of the handler, and a type which is used to determine whether the handler will handle a particular exception.

When an exception is thrown, the call stack is unwound until a method is found that contains a handler which covers the current program counter and whose type is a supertype of the type of the object thrown. The method containing the handler is reactivated and the program counter is set to point to the first address of the handler. The value and scope stacks in the handling method are cleared before the handler is entered.

A finally clause is normally translated as an exception handler that accepts any type of value, which it catches and rethrows after the body of the finally block finishes executing.

## <span id="page-15-4"></span>*3.4 Verification*

As noted earlier, verification does not happen all at once. Verification is often put off until a datum is actually needed or until some dependent object has been loaded, so that forward references will be possible.

The following list summarizes some of the verification errors signaled by the AVM2. (Not all verification errors are listed.)

- There must be no nonzero bits above bit 30 in a u30 value.
- No control flow instruction must cause control to be transferred outside the code vector or into the middle of another instruction.
- Multiple control flow instructions to the same instruction must have compatible scope stacks, operand stacks, and register values.
- Named types (for example, in coerce instructions or in a base class reference) must always be uniquely resolvable.
- Names may not reference index zero of the name pool unless explicitly specified for that particular name field.

- Some name fields (for example, instance\_info) require the referenced name to be a QName.
- A class cannot subclass a final class or an interface.
- The interface set of a class cannot reference interface zero, and must reference interfaces (not classes).
- Method indices for callmethod and callstatic must provably be within the range of the receiver object's method table.
- When an instruction definition section contains wording along the lines of "<value> must be less than <constraint>", this usually implies a static constraint that is checked by the verifier.

# <span id="page-17-1"></span><span id="page-17-0"></span>4 The ActionScript Byte Code (abc) format

Syntactically complete sections of ActionScript code are processed by a compiler into ActionScript Byte Code segments. These segments are described by the abcFile structure, which is defined below. The abcFile structure is the unit of loading and execution used by the AVM2.

The abcFile structure describes the interpretation of a block of 8-bit bytes. Despite the name, the contents of an abcFile does not need to be read from a file in the file system; it can be generated dynamically by a runtime compiler or other tools. The use of the word "file" is historical.

The abcFile structure comprises primitive data, structured data, and arrays of primitive and structured data. The following sections describe all the data formats.

Primitive data include integers and floating-point numbers encoded in various ways.

Structured data, including the abcFile itself, are presented here using a C-like structural notation, with individual named fields. Fields within this structure are in reality just sequences of bytes that are interpreted according to their type. The fields are stored sequentially without any padding or alignment.

# <span id="page-17-2"></span>*4.1 Primitive data types*

Multi-byte primitive data are stored in little-endian order (less significant bytes precede more significant bytes). Negative integers are represented using two's complement.

- The type u8 represents a one-byte unsigned integer value.
- The type u16 represents a two-byte unsigned integer value.
- The type s24 represents a three-byte signed integer value.
- The type u30 represents a variable-length encoded 30-bit unsigned integer value.
- The types u32 and s32 represent variable-length encoded 32-bit unsigned and signed integer values respectively.
- The type d64 defines an 8-byte IEEE-754 floating point value. The high byte of the double value contains the sign and upper bits of the exponent, and the low byte contains the least significant bits of the significand.

The variable-length encoding for u30, u32, and s32 uses one to five bytes, depending on the magnitude of the value encoded. Each byte contributes its low seven bits to the value. If the high (eighth) bit of a byte is set, then the next byte of the abcFile is also part of the value. In the case of s32, sign extension is applied: the seventh bit of the last byte of the encoding is propagated to fill out the 32 bits of the decoded value.

## <span id="page-18-1"></span><span id="page-18-0"></span>*4.2 abcFile*

```
abcFile 
{ 
 u16 minor_version 
 u16 major_version 
 cpool_info constant_pool 
 u30 method_count 
 method_info method[method_count] 
 u30 metadata_count 
 metadata_info metadata[metadata_count] 
 u30 class_count 
 instance_info instance[class_count] 
 class_info class[class_count] 
 u30 script_count 
 script_info script[script_count] 
 u30 method_body_count 
 method_body_info method_body[method_body_count] 
}
```

The abcFile structure describes an executable code block with all its constant data, type descriptors, code, and metadata. It comprises the following fields.

```
minor_version, major_version
```

The values of major\_version and minor\_version are the major and minor version numbers of the abcFile format. A change in the minor version number signifies a change in the file format that is backward compatible, in the sense that an implementation of the AVM2 can still make use of a file of an older version. A change in the major version number denotes an incompatible adjustment to the file format.

As of the publication of this overview, the major version is 46 and the minor version is 16.

```
constant_pool
```

The constant\_pool is a variable length structure composed of integers, doubles, strings, namespaces, namespace sets, and multinames. These constants are referenced from other parts of the abcFile structure.

```
method_count, method
```

The value of method\_count is the number of entries in the method array. Each entry in the method array is a variable length method\_info structure. The array holds information about every method defined in this abcFile. The code for method bodies is held separately in the method\_body array (see below). Some entries in method may have no body—this is the case for native methods, for example.

```
metadata_count, metadata
```

The value of metadata\_count is the number of entries in the metadata array. Each metadata entry is a metadata\_info structure that maps a name to a set of string values.

```
class_count, instance, class
```

The value of class\_count is the number of entries in the instance and class arrays.

Each instance entry is a variable length instance\_info structure which specifies the characteristics of object instances created by a particular class.

Each class entry defines the characteristics of a class. It is used in conjunction with the instance field to derive a full description of an AS Class.

```
script_count, script
```

The value of script\_count is the number of entries in the script array. Each script entry is a script\_info structure that defines the characteristics of a single script in this file. As explained in the previous chapter, the last entry in this array is the entry point for execution in the abcFile.

```
method_body_count, method_body
```

The value of method\_body\_count is the number of entries in the method\_body array. Each method\_body entry consists of a variable length method\_body\_info structure which contains the instructions for an individual method or function.

## <span id="page-19-1"></span>*4.3 Constant pool*

The constant pool is a block of array-based entries that reflect the constants used by all methods. Each of the count entries (for example, int\_count) must be one more than the number of entries in the corresponding array, and the first entry in the array is element "1". For all constant pools, the index "0" has a special meaning, typically a sensible default value. For example, the "0" entry is used to represent the empty sting (""), the any namespace, or the any type (\*) depending on the context it is used in. When "0" has a special meaning it is described in the text below.

```
cpool_info 
{ 
 u30 int_count 
 s32 integer[int_count] 
 u30 uint_count 
 u32 uinteger[uint_count] 
 u30 double_count 
 d64 double[double_count] 
 u30 string_count 
 string_info string[string_count] 
 u30 namespace_count 
 namespace_info namespace[namespace_count] 
 u30 ns_set_count 
 ns_set_info ns_set[ns_set_count] 
 u30 multiname_count 
 multiname_info multiname[multiname_count] 
}
```

If there is more than one entry in one of these arrays for the same entity, such as a name, the AVM may or may not consider those two entries to mean the same thing. The AVM currently guarantees that names flagged as belonging to the "private" namespace are treated as unique.

```
int_count, integer
```

The value of int\_count is the number of entries in the integer array, plus one. The integer array holds integer constants referenced by the bytecode. The "0" entry of the integer array is not present in the abcFile; it represents the zero value for the purposes of providing values for optional parameters and field initialization.

```
uint_count, uinteger
```

The value of uint\_count is the number of entries in the uinteger array, plus one. The uinteger array holds unsigned integer constants referenced by the bytecode. The "0" entry of the uinteger array is not present in the abcFile; it represents the zero value for the purposes of providing values for optional parameters and field initialization.

```
double_count, double
```

The value of double\_count is the number of entries in the double array, plus one. The double array holds IEEE double-precision floating point constants referenced by the bytecode. The "0" entry of the double array is not present in the abcFile; it represents the NaN (Not-a-Number) value for the purposes of providing values for optional parameters and field initialization.

```
string_count, string
```

The value of string\_count is the number of entries in the string array, plus one. The string array holds UTF-8 encoded strings referenced by the compiled code and by many other parts of the abcFile. In addition to describing string constants in programs, string data in the constant pool are used in the description of names of many kinds. Entry "0" of the string array is not present in the abcFile; it represents the empty string in most contexts but is also used to represent the "any" name in others (known as "\*" in ActionScript).

```
namespace_count, namespace
```

The value of namespace\_count is the number of entries in the namespace array, plus one. The namespace array describes the namespaces used by the bytecode and also for names of many kinds. Entry "0" of the namespace array is not present in the abcFile; it represents the "any" namespace (known as "\*" in ActionScript).

```
ns_set_count, ns_set
```

The value of ns\_set\_count is the number of entries in the ns\_set array, plus one. The ns\_set array describes namespace sets used in the descriptions of multinames. The "0" entry of the ns\_set array is not present in the abcFile.

```
multiname_count, multiname
```

The value of multiname\_count is the number of entries in the multiname array, plus one. The multiname array describes names used by the bytecode. The "0" entry of the multiname array is not present in the abcFile.

# <span id="page-20-1"></span>*4.4 String*

A string\_info element encodes a string of 16-bit characters on a length-and-data format. The meaning of each character is normally taken to be that of a Unicode 16-bit code point. The data are UTF-8 encoded. For more information on Unicode, see [unicode.org.](http://unicode.org/)

```
string_info 
{ 
 u30 size 
 u8 utf8[size] 
}
```

## <span id="page-21-0"></span>4.4.1 Namespace

<span id="page-21-1"></span>A namespace\_info entry defines a namespace. Namespaces have string names, represented by indices into the string array, and kinds. User-defined namespaces have kind CONSTANT\_Namespace or CONSTANT\_ExplicitNamespace and a non-empty name. System namespaces have empty names and one of the other kinds, and provides a means for the loader to map references to these namespaces onto internal entities.

```
namespace_info 
{ 
 u8 kind 
 u30 name 
}
```

A single byte defines the type of entry that follows, thus identifying how the name field should be interpreted by the loader. The name field is an index into the string section of the constant pool. A value of zero denotes an empty string. The table below lists the legal values for kind.

| Namespace Kind              | Value |
|-----------------------------|-------|
| CONSTANT_Namespace          | 0x08  |
| CONSTANT_PackageNamespace   | 0x16  |
| CONSTANT_PackageInternalNs  | 0x17  |
| CONSTANT_ProtectedNamespace | 0x18  |
| CONSTANT_ExplicitNamespace  | 0x19  |
| CONSTANT_StaticProtectedNs  | 0x1A  |
| CONSTANT_PrivateNs          | 0x05  |

## <span id="page-21-2"></span>4.4.2 Namespace set

An ns\_set\_info entry defines a set of namespaces, allowing the set to be used as a unit in the definition of multinames.

```
ns_set_info 
{ 
 u30 count 
 u30 ns[count] 
}
```

The count field defines how many ns's are identified for the entry, while each ns is an integer that indexes into the namespace array of the constant pool. No entry in the ns array may be zero.

## <span id="page-22-1"></span><span id="page-22-0"></span>4.4.3 Multiname

A multiname\_info entry is a variable length item that is used to define multiname entities used by the bytecode. There are many kinds of multinames. The kind field acts as a tag: its value determines how the loader should see the variable-length data field. The layout of the contents of the data field under a particular kind is described below by the multiname\_kind\_ structures.

```
multiname_info 
{ 
 u8 kind 
 u8 data[] 
}
```

| Multiname Kind       | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| CONSTANT_QName       | 0x07  |
| CONSTANT_QNameA      | 0x0D  |
| CONSTANT_RTQName     | 0x0F  |
| CONSTANT_RTQNameA    | 0x10  |
| CONSTANT_RTQNameL    | 0x11  |
| CONSTANT_RTQNameLA   | 0x12  |
| CONSTANT_Multiname   | 0x09  |
| CONSTANT_MultinameA  | 0x0E  |
| CONSTANT_MultinameL  | 0x1B  |
| CONSTANT_MultinameLA | 0x1C  |

Those constants ending in "A" (such as CONSTANT\_QNameA) represent the names of attributes.

#### *QName*

The multiname\_kind\_QName format is used for kinds CONSTANT\_QName and CONSTANT\_QNameA.

```
multiname_kind_QName 
{ 
 u30 ns 
 u30 name 
}
```

The ns and name fields are indexes into the namespace and string arrays of the constant\_pool entry, respectively. A value of zero for the ns field indicates the any ("\*") namespace, and a value of zero for the name field indicates the any ("\*") name.

## *RTQName*

The multiname\_kind\_RTQName format is used for kinds CONSTANT\_RTQName and CONSTANT\_RTQNameA.

```
multiname_kind_RTQName 
{ 
 u30 name 
}
```

The single field, name, is an index into the string array of the constant pool. A value of zero indicates the any ("\*") name.

## <span id="page-23-0"></span>*RTQNameL*

The multiname\_kind\_RTQNameL format is used for kinds CONSTANT\_RTQNameL and CONSTANT\_RTQNameLA. multiname\_kind\_RTQNameL { }

This kind has no associated data.

### *Multiname*

The multiname\_kind\_Multiname format is used for kinds CONSTANT\_Multiname and CONSTANT\_MultinameA. multiname\_kind\_Multiname { u30 name

} The name field is an index into the string array, and the ns\_set field is an index into the ns\_set array. A

value of zero for the name field indicates the any ("\*") name. The value of ns\_set cannot be zero.

## *MultinameL*

u30 ns\_set

The multiname\_kind\_MultinameL format is used for kinds CONSTANT\_MultinameL and CONSTANT\_MultinameLA. multiname\_kind\_MultinameL { u30 ns\_set }

The ns\_set field is an index into the ns\_set array of the constant pool. The value of ns\_set cannot be zero.

## <span id="page-23-1"></span>*4.5 Method signature*

The method\_info entry defines the signature of a single method.

```
method_info 
{ 
 u30 param_count 
 u30 return_type 
 u30 param_type[param_count] 
 u30 name 
 u8 flags 
 option_info options 
 param_info param_names 
}
```

## The fields are as follows:

```
param_count, param_type
```

The param\_count field is the number of formal parameters that the method supports; it also represents the length of the param\_type array. Each entry in the param\_type array is an index into the multiname <span id="page-24-0"></span>array of the constant pool; the name at that entry provides the name of the type of the corresponding formal parameter. A zero value denotes the any ("\*") type.

```
return_type
```

The return\_type field is an index into the multiname array of the constant pool; the name at that entry provides the name of the return type of this method. A zero value denotes the any ("\*") type.

name

The name field is an index into the string array of the constant pool; the string at that entry provides the name of this method. If the index is zero, this method has no name.

flags

The flag field is a bit vector that provides additional information about the method. The bits are described by the following table. (Bits not described in the table should all be set to zero.)

| Name            | Value | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                  |  |
|-----------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| NEED_ARGUMENTS  | 0x01  | Suggests to the run-time that an "arguments" object (as specified by the<br>ActionScript 3.0 Language Reference) be created. Must not be used<br>together with NEED_REST. See Chapter 3. |  |
| NEED_ACTIVATION | 0x02  | Must be set if this method uses the newactivation opcode.                                                                                                                                |  |
| NEED_REST       | 0x04  | This flag creates an ActionScript 3.0 rest arguments array. Must not be<br>used with NEED_ARGUMENTS. See Chapter 3.                                                                      |  |
| HAS_OPTIONAL    | 0x08  | Must be set if this method has optional parameters and the options<br>field is present in this method_info structure.                                                                    |  |
| SET_DXNS        | 0x40  | Must be set if this method uses the dxns or dxnslate opcodes.                                                                                                                            |  |
| HAS_PARAM_NAMES | 0x80  | Must be set when the param_names field is present in this method_info<br>structure.                                                                                                      |  |

options

This entry may be present only if the HAS\_OPTIONAL flag is set in flags.

param\_names

This entry may be present only if the HAS\_PARAM\_NAMES flag is set in flags.

## 4.5.1 Optional parameters

<span id="page-24-1"></span>The option\_info entry is used to define the default values for the optional parameters of the method. The number of optional parameters is given by option\_count, which must not be zero nor greater than the parameter\_count field of the enclosing method\_info structure.

```
option_info 
{ 
 u30 option_count 
 option_detail option[option_count] 
} 
option_detail 
{ 
 u30 val 
 u8 kind 
}
```

Each optional value consists of a kind field that denotes the type of value represented, and a val field that is an index into one of the array entries of the constant pool. The correct array is selected based on the kind.

| Value | Entry     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0x03  | integer   |
| 0x04  | uinteger  |
| 0x06  | double    |
| 0x01  | string    |
| 0x0B  | -         |
| 0x0A  | -         |
| 0x0C  | -         |
| 0x00  | -         |
| 0x08  | namespace |
| 0x16  | namespace |
| 0x17  | Namespace |
| 0x18  | Namespace |
| 0x19  | Namespace |
| 0x1A  | Namespace |
| 0x05  | namespace |
|       |           |

## <span id="page-26-1"></span><span id="page-26-0"></span>4.5.2 Parameter names

The param\_names entry is available only when the HAS\_PARAM\_NAMES bit is set in the flags. Each param\_info element of the array is an index into the constant pool's string array. The parameter name entry exists solely for external tool use and is not used by the AVM2.

```
param_info 
{ 
 u30 param_name[param_count] 
}
```

## *4.6 metadata\_info*

<span id="page-26-2"></span>The metadata\_info entry provides a means of embedding arbitrary key /value pairs into the ABC file. The AVM2 will ignore all such entries.

```
metadata_info 
{ 
 u30 name 
 u30 item_count 
 item_info items[item_count] 
}
```

The name field is an index into the string array of the constant pool; it provides a name for the metadata entry. The value of the name field must not be zero. Zero or more items may be associated with the entry; item\_count denotes the number of items that follow in the items array.

```
item_info 
{ 
 u30 key 
 u30 value 
}
```

The item\_info entry consists of item\_count elements that are interpreted as key/value pairs of indices into the string table of the constant pool. If the value of key is zero, this is a keyless entry and only carries a value.

## <span id="page-27-1"></span><span id="page-27-0"></span>*4.7 Instance*

The instance\_info entry is used to define the characteristics of a run-time object (a class instance) within the AVM2. The corresponding class\_info entry is used in order to fully define an ActionScript 3.0 Class.

```
instance_info 
{ 
 u30 name 
       u30 super_name 
       u8 flags 
       u30 protectedNs 
       u30 intrf_count 
       u30 interface[intrf_count] 
       u30 iinit 
       u30 trait_count 
       traits_info trait[trait_count] 
}
```

The name field is an index into the multiname array of the constant pool; it provides a name for the class. The entry specified must be a QName.

```
super_name
```

The super\_name field is an index into the multiname array of the constant pool; it provides the name of the base class of this class, if any. A value of zero indicates that this class has no base class.

flags

name

The flags field is used to identify various options when interpreting the instance\_info entry. It is bit vector; the following entries are defined. Other bits must be zero.

| Name                           | Value | Meaning                                                                                              |
|--------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CONSTANT_ClassSealed           | 0x01  | The class is sealed: properties can not be dynamically added<br>to instances of the class.           |
| CONSTANT_ClassFinal            | 0x02  | The class is final: it cannot be a base class for any other<br>class.                                |
| CONSTANT_ClassInterface        | 0x04  | The class is an interface.                                                                           |
| CONSTANT_ClassProtectedNs 0x08 |       | The class uses its protected namespace and the<br>protectedNs field is present in the interface_info |
|                                |       | structure.                                                                                           |

protectedNs

This field is present only if the CONSTANT\_ProtectedNs bit of flags is set. It is an index into the namespace array of the constant pool and identifies the namespace that serves as the protected namespace for this class.

```
intrf_count, interface
```

The value of the intrf\_count field is the number of entries in the interface array. The interface array contains indices into the multiname array of the constant pool; the referenced names specify the interfaces implemented by this class. None of the indices may be zero.

<span id="page-28-0"></span>iinit

This is an index into the method array of the abcFile; it references the method that is invoked whenever an object of this class is constructed. This method is sometimes referred to as an instance initializer.

```
trait_count, trait
```

The value of trait\_count is the number of elements in the trait array. The trait array defines the set of traits of a class instance. The next section defines the meaning of the traits\_info structure.

## <span id="page-28-1"></span>*4.8 Trait*

A trait is a fixed property of an object or class; it has a name, a type, and some associated data. The traits\_info structure bundles these data.

```
traits_info 
{ 
       u30 name 
 u8 kind 
       u8 data[] 
       u30 metadata_count 
       u30 metadata[metadata_count] 
}
```

The name field is an index into the multiname array of the constant pool; it provides a name for the trait. The value can not be zero, and the multiname entry specified must be a QName.

kind

name

The kind field contains two four-bit fields. The lower four bits determine the kind of this trait. The upper four bits comprise a bit vector providing attributes of the trait. See the following tables and sections for full descriptions.

data

The interpretation of the data field depends on the type of the trait, which is provided by the low four bits of the kind field. See below for a full description.

```
metadata_count, metadata
```

These fields are present only if ATTR\_Metadata is present in the upper four bits of the kind field.

The value of the metadata\_count field is the number of entries in the metadata array. That array contains indices into the metadata array of the abcFile.

# 4.8.1 Summary of trait types

<span id="page-28-2"></span>The following table summarizes the trait types.

| Value |
|-------|
| 0     |
| 1     |
| 2     |
| 3     |
| 4     |
| 5     |
| 6     |
|       |

## <span id="page-29-1"></span><span id="page-29-0"></span>4.8.2 Slot and const traits

A kind value of Trait\_Slot (0) or Trait\_Const (6) requires that the data field be read using trait\_slot, which takes the following form:

```
trait_slot 
{ 
 u30 slot_id 
 u30 type_name 
      u30 vindex 
      u8 vkind 
} 
slot_id
```

The slot\_id field is an integer from 0 to N and is used to identify a position in which this trait resides. A value of 0 requests the AVM2 to assign a position.

type\_name

This field is used to identify the type of the trait. It is an index into the multiname array of the constant\_pool. A value of zero indicates that the type is the any type (\*).

vindex

This field is an index that is used in conjunction with the vkind field in order to define a value for the trait. If it is 0, vkind is empty; otherwise it references one of the tables in the constant pool, depending on the value of vkind.

vkind

This field exists only when vindex is non-zero. It is used to determine how vindex will be interpreted. See the "Constant Kind" table above for details.

## <span id="page-29-2"></span>4.8.3 Class traits

A kind value of Trait\_Class (0x04) implies that the trait\_class entry should be used.

```
trait_class 
{ 
 u30 slot_id 
 u30 classi 
} 
slot_id
```

The slot\_id field is an integer from 0 to N and is used to identify a position in which this trait resides. A value of 0 requests the AVM2 to assign a position.

class

The classi field is an index that points into the class array of the abcFile entry.

## <span id="page-30-0"></span>4.8.4 Function traits

<span id="page-30-1"></span>A kind value of Trait\_Function (0x05) implies that the trait\_function entry should be used.

```
trait_function 
{ 
 u30 slot_id 
 u30 function 
} 
slot_id
```

The slot\_id field is an integer from 0 to N and is used to identify a position in which this trait resides. A value of 0 requests the AVM2 to assign a position.

function

The function field is an index that points into the method array of the abcFile entry.

# <span id="page-30-2"></span>4.8.5 Method, getter, and setter traits

A kind value of Trait\_Method (0x01), Trait\_Getter (0x02) or Trait\_Setter (0x03) implies that the trait\_method entry should be used.

```
trait_method 
{ 
 u30 disp_id 
 u30 method 
} 
disp_id
```

The disp\_id field is a compiler assigned integer that is used by the AVM2 to optimize the resolution of virtual function calls. An overridden method must have the same disp\_id as that of the method in the base class. A value of zero disables this optimization.

method

The method field is an index that points into the method array of the abcFile entry.

## 4.8.6 Trait attributes

<span id="page-30-3"></span>As previously mentioned the upper nibble of the kind field is used to encode attributes. A description of how the attributes are interpreted for each kind is outlined below. Any other combination of attribute with kind is ignored.

| Attributes    | Value |                                                                                                                         |
|---------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ATTR_Final    | 0x1   | Is used with Trait_Method, Trait_Getter and Trait_Setter. It marks a<br>method that cannot be overridden by a sub-class |
| ATTR_Override | 0x2   | Is used with Trait_Method, Trait_Getter and Trait_Setter. It marks a<br>method that has been overridden in this class   |
| ATTR_Metadata | 0x4   | Is used to signal that the fields metadata_count and metadata follow the<br>data field in the traits_info entry         |

# <span id="page-30-4"></span>*4.9 Class*

The class\_info entry is used to define characteristics of an ActionScript 3.0 class.

```
class_info 
{ 
 u30 cinit 
 u30 trait_count 
       traits_info traits[trait_count] 
} 
cinit
```

This is an index into the method array of the abcFile; it references the method that is invoked when the class is first created. This method is also known as the static initializer for the class.

```
trait_count, trait
```

The value of trait\_count is the number of entries in the trait array. The trait array holds the traits for the class (see above for information on traits).

## <span id="page-31-1"></span>*4.10 Script*

The script\_info entry is used to define characteristics of an ActionScript 3.0 script.

```
script_info 
{ 
 u30 init 
 u30 trait_count 
       traits_info trait[trait_count] 
} 
init
```

The init field is an index into the method array of the abcFile. It identifies a function that is to be invoked prior to any other code in this script.

```
trait_count, trait
```

The value of trait\_count is the number of entries in the trait array. The trait array is the set of traits defined by the script.

# <span id="page-31-2"></span>*4.11 Method body*

The method\_body\_info entry holds the AVM2 instructions that are associated with a particular method or function body. Some of the fields in this entry declare the maximum amount of resources the body will consume during execution. These declarations allow the AVM2 to anticipate the requirements of the method without analyzing the method body prior to execution. The declarations also serve as promises about the resource boundary within which the method has agreed to remain.[3](#page-31-3)

There can be fewer method bodies in the method\_body table than than there are method signatures in the method table—some methods have no bodies. Therefore the method\_body contains a reference to the method it belongs to, and other parts of the abcFile always reference the method table, not the method\_body table.

<span id="page-31-3"></span> 3 Any code loaded from an untrusted source will be examined in order to verify that the code stays within the declared limits.

```
method_body_info 
{ 
 u30 method 
       u30 max_stack 
       u30 local_count 
       u30 init_scope_depth 
       u30 max_scope_depth 
       u30 code_length 
       u8 code[code_length] 
       u30 exception_count 
       exception_info exception[exception_count] 
       u30 trait_count 
       traits_info trait[trait_count] 
}
```

method

The method field is an index into the method array of the abcFile; it identifies the method signature with which this body is to be associated.

max\_stack

The max\_stack field is maximum number of evaluation stack slots used at any point during the execution of this body.

local\_count

The local\_count field is the index of the highest-numbered local register this method will use, plus one.

init\_scope\_depth

The init\_scope\_depth field defines the minimum scope depth, relative to max\_scope\_depth, that may be accessed within the method.

```
max_scope_depth
```

The max\_scope\_depth field defines the maximum scope depth that may be accessed within the method. The difference between max\_scope\_depth and init\_scope\_depth determines the size of the local scope stack.

```
code_length, code
```

The value of code\_length is the number of bytes in the code array. The code array holds AVM2 instructions for this method body. The AVM2 instruction set is defined in Section 2.5.

```
exception_count, exception
```

The value of exception\_count is the number of elements in the exception array. The exception array associates exception handlers with ranges of instructions within the code array (see below).

```
trait_count
```

The value of trait\_count is the number of elements in the trait array. The trait array contains all the traits for this method body (see above for more information on traits).

## <span id="page-33-1"></span><span id="page-33-0"></span>*4.12 Exception*

The exception\_info entry is used to define the range of ActionScript 3.0 instructions over which a particular exception handler is engaged.

```
exception_info 
{ 
 u30 from 
 u30 to 
       u30 target 
       u30 exc_type 
       u30 var_name 
}
```

The starting position in the code field from which the exception is enabled.

to

from

The ending position in the code field after which the exception is disabled.

target

The position in the code field to which control should jump if an exception of type exc\_type is encountered while executing instructions that lie within the region [from, to] of the code field.

```
exc_type
```

An index into the string array of the constant pool that identifies the name of the type of exception that is to be monitored during the reign of this handler. A value of zero means the any type ("\*") and implies that this exception handler will catch any type of exception thrown.

```
var_name
```

This index into the string array of the constant pool defines the name of the variable that is to receive the exception object when the exception is thrown and control is transferred to target location. If the value is zero then there is no name associated with the exception object.

# <span id="page-34-1"></span><span id="page-34-0"></span>5 AVM2 instructions

The AVM2 instruction descriptions follow the following format.

## instruction name

## Operation

Brief description of the instruction.

## Format

A description of the instruction with any operands that appear with it in the code.

```
instruction 
operand1 
operand2 
...
```

#### Forms

instruction = opcode

### Stack

A description of the stack before and after the instruction is executed. The stack top is on the right; portions marked ... are not altered by the instruction.

```
..., value1, value2 => ..., value3
```

#### Description

A detailed description of the instruction, including information about the effect on the stack, information of the operands, result of the instruction, etc.

#### Runtime exceptions

A description of any errors that may be thrown by this instruction. A number of these instructions may invoke operations behind the scene. For example, name resolution can fail to find a name or it can resolve it ambiguously; value conversion can run arbitrary user code that may fail and therefore throw exceptions. To the program it will appear as if the instruction threw those exceptions, but they will not be noted in the description of the instruction.

#### Notes

Additional information that may be useful.

## add

## Operation

Add two values.

#### Format

add

#### Forms

add = 160 (0xa0)

## Stack

…, *value1*, *value2* => …, *value3* 

## Description

Pop *value1* and *value2* off of the stack and add them together as specified in ECMA-262 section 11.6 and as extended in ECMA-357 section 11.4. The algorithm is briefly described below.

- 1. If *value1* and *value2* are both Numbers, then set *value3* to the result of adding the two number values. See ECMA-262 section 11.6.3 for a description of adding number values.
- 2. If *value1* or *value2* is a String or a Date, convert both values to String using the ToString algorithm described in ECMA-262 section 9.8. Concatenate the string value of *value2* to the string value of *value1* and set *value3* to the new concatenated String.
- 3. If *value1* and *value2* are both of type XML or XMLList, construct a new XMLList object, then call [[Append]](value1), and then [[Append]](*value2*). Set *value3* to the new XMLList. See ECMA-357 section 9.2.1.6 for a description of the [[Append]] method.
- 4. If none of the above apply, convert *value1* and *value2* to primitives. This is done by calling ToPrimitive with no hint. This results in *value1\_primitive* and *value2\_primitive*. If *value1\_primitive* or *value2\_primitive* is a String then convert both to Strings using the ToString algorithm (ECMA-262 section 9.8), concatenate the results, and set *value3* to the concatenated String. Otherwise convert both to Numbers using the ToNumber algorithm (ECMA-262 section 9.3), add the results, and set *value3* to the result of the addition.

Push *value3* onto the stack.

## Notes

For more information, see ECMA-262 section 11.6 ("Additive Operators") and ECMA-357 section 11.4.

## add\_i

…, *obj*, [*ns*], [*name*] => …, *value* 

#### Description

*index* is a u30 that must be an index into the multiname constant pool. If the multiname at that index is a runtime multiname the name and/or namespace will also appear on the stack so that the multiname can be constructed correctly at runtime.

*obj* is the object to find the descendants in. This will invoke the [[Descendants]] property on *obj* with the multiname specified by *index.* For a description of the [[Descendants]] operator, see the E4X spec (ECMA-357) sections 9.1.1.8 (for the XML type) and 9.2.1.8 (for the XMLList type).

#### Runtime exceptions

A TypeError is thrown if *obj* is not of type XML or XMLList.

# getglobalscope

### Operation

### Format

```
getglobalslot 
slotindex
```

## Forms

```
getglobalslot = 110 (0x6e)
```

## Stack

```
… => …, value
```

#### Description

*slotindex* is a u30 that must be an index of a slot on the global scope. The *slotindex* must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the total number of slots the global scope has.

This will retrieve the value stored in the slot at *slotindex* of the global scope. This value is pushed onto the stack.

## getlex

### Operation

Find and get a property.

## Format

```
getlex 
index
```

#### Forms

```
getlex = 96 (0x60)
```

#### Stack

… => …, *obj* 

## Description

*index* is a u30 that must be an index into the multiname constant pool. The multiname at *index* must not be a runtime multiname, so there are never any optional namespace or name values on the stack.

This is the equivalent of doing a findpropstict followed by a getproperty. It will find the object on the scope stack that contains the property, and then will get the value from that object. See "[Resolving multinames](#page-9-1)" on page [1](#page-9-1)0.

## Runtime exceptions

A ReferenceError is thrown if the property is unresolved in all of the objects on the scope stack.

# getlocal

### Operation

```

#### Stack

```
…, object, [ns], [name] => …, value
```

## Description

*index* is a u30 that must be an index into the multiname constant pool. If the multiname at that index is a runtime multiname the name and/or namespace will also appear on the stack so that the multiname can be constructed correctly at runtime.

The property with the name specified by the multiname will be resolved in *object*, and the value of that property will be pushed onto the stack. If the property is unresolved, undefined is pushed onto the stack. See "[Resolving multinames](#page-9-1)" on page [1](#page-9-1)0.

## getscopeobject

### Operation

Get a scope object.

### Format

```

```

#### Stack

```
… => …, scope
```

## Description

*index* is an unsigned byte that specifies the index of the scope object to retrieve from the local scope stack. *index* must be less than the current depth of the scope stack. The scope at that index is retrieved and pushed onto the stack. The scope at the top of the stack is at index scope\_depth-1, and the scope at the bottom of the stack is index 0.

## Notes

The indexing of elements on the local scope stack is the reverse of the indexing of elements on the local operand stack.

```

## Description

*index* is a u30 that must be an index into the multiname constant pool. If the multiname at that index is a runtime multiname the name and/or namespace will also appear on the stack so that the multiname can be constructed correctly at runtime

Once the multiname is constructed, the base class of *obj* is determined and the multiname is resolved in the declared traits of the base class. The value of the resolved property is pushed onto the stack. See "[Resolving multinames](#page-9-1)" on page [1](#page-9-1)0.

## Runtime exceptions

A TypeError is thrown if *obj* is null or undefined.

A ReferenceError is thrown if the property is unresolved, or if the property is write-only.

## hasnext

## Operation

Determine if the given object has any more properties.

## Format

hasnext

## Forms

```
hasnext = 31(0x1f)
```

## Stack

```
…, obj, cur_index => …, next_index
```

#### Description

*cur\_index* and *obj* are popped off of the stack. *cur\_index* must be of type int. Get the index of the next property after the property at cur\_index. If there are no more properties, then the result is 0. The result is pushed onto the stack.

## hasnext2

### Operation

Determine if the given object has any more properties.

### Format

```
hasnext2 
object_reg 
index_reg
```

## Forms

```
hasnext2 = 50 (0x32)
```

## Stack

```
…, => …, value
```

### Description

*object\_reg* and *index\_reg* are uints that must be indexes to a local register. The value of the register at position *object\_reg* is the object that is being enumerated and is assigned to *obj*. The value of the register at position *index\_reg* must be of type int, and that value is assigned to *cur\_index*.

Get the index of the next property after the property located at index *cur\_index* on object *obj*. If there are no more properties on *obj*, then *obj* is set to the next object on the prototype chain of *obj*, and *cur\_index* is set to the first index of that object. If there are no more objects on the prototype chain and there are no more properties on *obj*, then *obj* is set to null, and *cur\_index* is set to 0.

The register at position *object\_reg* is set to the value of *obj*, and the register at position *index\_reg* is set to the value of *cur\_index*.

If index is not 0, then push true. Otherwise push false.

### Notes

hasnext2 works by reference. Each time it is executed it changes the values of local registers rather than simply returning a new value. This is because the object being enumerated can change when it is necessary to walk up the prototype chain to find more properties. This is different from how hasnext works, though the two may seem similar due to the similar names.

*index* is a u30 that must be an index into the multiname constant pool. If the multiname at that index is a runtime multiname the name and/or namespace will also appear on the stack so that the multiname can be constructed correctly at runtime.

The property with the name specified by the multiname will be resolved in *object*, and will be set to *value.* This is used to initialize properties in the initializer method. When used in an initializer method it is able to set the value of const properties.

## Runtime exceptions

A TypeError is thrown if *object* is null or undefined.

A ReferenceError is thrown if the property is not found and *object* is not dynamic, or if the instruction is used to set a const property outside an initializer method.

# instanceof

kill = 8 (0x08)
```

#### Stack

```
… => …
```

#### Description

*index* is a u30 that must be an index of a local register. The local register at *index* is killed. It is killed by setting its value to undefined.

## Notes

This is usually used so that different jumps to the same location will have the same types in the local registers. The verifier ensures that all paths to a location have compatible values in the local registers, if not a VerifyError occurs. This can be used to kill temporary values that were stored in local registers before a jump so that no VerifyError occurs.

# label

## Operation

Do nothing.

## Format

label

#### Forms

```
label = 9 (0x09)
```

## Stack

… => …

## Description

Do nothing. Used to indicate that this location is the target of a branch.

lookupswitch = 27(0x1b)
```

#### Stack

```
…, index => …
```

## Description

*default\_offset* is an s24 that is the offset to jump, in bytes, for the default case. *case\_offsets* are each an s24 that is the offset to jump for a particular index. There are *case\_count+1* case offsets. *case\_count* is a u30.

*index* is popped off of the stack and must be of type int. If *index* is less than zero or greater than *case\_count*, the target is calculated by adding *default\_offset* to the base location. Otherwise the target is calculated by adding the *case\_offset* at position *index* to the base location. Execution continues from the target location.

The base location is the address of the lookupswitch instruction itself.

## Stack

…, *value* => …

#### Description

The top value of the stack is popped off the stack and then thrown. The thrown value can be of any type.

When a throw is executed, the current method's exception handler table is searched for an exception handler. An exception handler matches if its range of offsets includes the offset of this instruction, and if its type matches the type of the thrown object, or is a base class of the type thrown. The first handler that matches is the one used.

If a handler is found then the stack is cleared, the exception object is pushed onto the stack, and then execution resumes at the instruction offset specified by the handler.

If a handler is not found, then the method exits, and the exception is rethrown in the invoking method, at which point it is searched for an exception handler as described here.

# <span id="page-106-1"></span><span id="page-106-0"></span>6 Hints for compiler writers

The following techniques may be useful to compiler writers targeting the AVM2.

## <span id="page-106-2"></span>*6.1 Reestablishing the scope stack following an exception*

When an exception handler is entered, the scope stack established in the catching method has been cleared (see the description of throw in the previous chapter). This is not always desired; a try..catch statement inside a with statement requires the extended scope of the with to still be established. The way to work around the clearing of the scope stack is for the exception handler to reestablish the scope stack by pushing the correct set of objects onto it before executing the body of the handler. That is, in this code:

```
 with (x) { 
 try { 
 ... 
 } 
 catch (e) { 
 return y 
 } 
 }
```

the body of the catch clause needs to look something like this, assuming x is in local 0:

```
 getlocal_0 
 pushwith 
     ... ; set up catch scope 
 findproperty "y" 
 getproperty "y" 
 returnvalue
```

# <span id="page-106-3"></span>*6.2 In-line subroutines for handling "finally"*

A finally clause on a try block must be visited when control flows out of the try block (or out of the associated catch clause). It is possible to expand the body of the finally clause in-line everywhere it needs to be visited, but this tends to greatly increase the amount of compiled code in the program. A more reasonable approach is to expand the finally clause once and visit it by means of the jump instruction. To have this "subroutine" return to the point from which it was "called", the "caller" stores a value identifying itself in a local variable. The finally clause returns to this location by means of a lookupswitch instruction:

```
 pushshort 0 
 setlocal_0 
 jump L1 
R1 ... ; Code following subroutine call 
 ... 
 pushshort 1 
 setlocal_0 
 jump L1 
R2 ... ; Code following subroutine call 
 ... 
L1 ; Subroutine. Return "address" in local 0 
    ... ; Body of subroutine 
 getlocal_0 
 lookupswitch 
 0 -> R1 
 1 -> R2
```

(This only highlights the fact that lookupswitch is a computed goto.)

## <span id="page-107-1"></span>*6.3 Creating an environment for nested functions*

ActionScript functions that are passed around as values close over their environment, including the environment's local variables, when they are created. Since the local registers of an activation are not captured when the newfunction instruction is executed, the environment for non-leaf functions must be stored in activation objects that can be captured properly. The newactivation instruction creates such an activation. Given the source code:

```
 function f(x) { 
 return function () { return x } 
 }
```

a suitable translation is along the lines of

```
 newactivation ; create a new activation record 
 dup ; and save a copy 
 pushscope ; and extend the current scope 
 getlocal_o ; get x parameter 
 setproperty "x" ; store x in the activation 
 newfunction <inner> ; create a new function 
 returnvalue
```

where <inner> is just a reference to the method body for the nested function. Note that newfunction captures the contents of the scope stack, but not the local registers or the operand stack.

# <span id="page-107-2"></span>*6.4 Optimizing method dispatch*

The instructions callmethod and callstatic can be used to optimize method dispatch. They require that the method properties of the receiver object be laid out in a particular order; the compiler provides explicit nonzero offsets for the methods in the trait\_method structure in the abcFile. The call instructions then call directly through the method table offsets, avoiding the name lookup. The verifier needs to be able to determine that the receiver object is of a type that has a method table that has a method at that offset. Usually this means that the receiver object can only be read by the bytecode from type-annotated locations, or that the call instruction must be preceded by a coerce instruction.
